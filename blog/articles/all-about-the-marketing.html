                <p class="blog-text">If you're just learning and want to know the basics of marketing, or you are sick
                    of listening to hundreds of videos, podcasts and mind-playing gurus, let Meowcating tell you like it
                    is!</p>
                <p class="blog-text">We'll try to explain it to you honestly. Without any hooks and any egocentric
                    direction, providing useful info after which you will not stay confused hopefully.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Ok, so let's start with it!</p>

                <h2 class="text-title">What the heck is Marketing?</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">Many people think of marketing only as selling and advertising. But it's only the
                    tip of the marketing iceberg.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Marketing is defined as:</p>

                    <p class="quote-text">A social and managerial process by which individuals and groups obtain what
                        they need and want through creating and exchanging products and values with others.</p>

            <div class="text-box no-title">
                <p class="blog-text">Ok, is anything more clear now? I doubt it. You would be amazed at how many
                    marketing definitions you can encounter while reading and studying. Like in some way they are trying
                    to confuse you.</p>

                <p class="blog-text">It's quite philosophical and untrue, but who I am? Just another fake guru kitty
                    writing an online article.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">I will tell you that marketing is putting business theory into practice. Doing
                    actions which leads you to successful product or service sale and keeping your end customers
                    satisfied.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">So basically anything you need to do to provide the best results for your business.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">You will run into dozens of famous fake gurus videos where they invite you for
                    special opportunities promising 6 or 7 figures income. They will teach you something here and there,
                    and keep you motivated, but the reality is that you will not hear about what marketing is, what
                    business is or even what are the best ways for you to succeed.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">And that is only valuable lesson from their side, which unfortunately 99 percent of
                    their customers don't see.</p>
            </div>
            <section class="text-box">
                <h2 class="text-title">So how to do real marketing?</h2>
                <ul class="text-list">
                    <li>Come up with your goal.</li>
                    <li>Understand your capabilities.</li>
                    <li>Find the easiest way to start getting the results.</li>
                    <li>Collect data, analyse, tweak and repeat until you see progress.</li>
                    <li>Keep doing it or change your business model if failing in the first case.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p class="blog-text">Ok, so you have a product or service. You need the target market you want to reach.
                    You need to define the customers/user tribe you want to reach. Depending on these two you will
                    decide on further steps.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">So when someone comes to you offering how to grow on Instagram or learn how to SEO
                    your website, he is inviting you to learn a certain skill. Before that, you need to realize what
                    skills and tools you need or don't need at all depending on your business description.</p>
            </div>
            <section class="text-box">
                <h2 class="text-title">Mistake number one</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">Learning all trends and tools available instead of focusing on actions necessary
                    for your business.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">If you want to be a marketer you need a set of actions which provides results, and
                    not to chase trends and try to grasp everything.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Trends are changing, business models are changing, so a real marketer adapts to it
                    when necessary.</p>

            <section class="text-box">
                <h2 class="text-title">Mistake number two</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">Searching for advice and blog articles about what you should do.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Throwing an eye is not a problem, but waiting for the third party to explain to you
                    what you need to do is not learning properly how to market.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="text-box">
                <h2 class="text-title">You are a third party as well. Are you
                    kidding me?</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">Ok, listen. You started your business. Let's say you researched and decided you
                    need to advertise through Facebook or TikTok ads. What is your next move?</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Sending a message to a social media manager promoted online, or joining a 2000
                    dollars course starting with listening to a deceiving automated fake live webinar?</p>
                <p class="blog-text">No!</p>
                <p class="blog-text">You should type www.facebook.com/business</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Look, it's all out there.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Are you starting waking up from deception of your mind, and not trusting yourself being content raped every day?</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Read through these links as new tabs. Scroll down and read. Take notes.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Ok wise guy fake guru kitty, but how will I know that I need Facebook ads in the first place if I didn't listen to fake gurus or some watering-down YouTube video speaker telling me about trends and promotional options?</p>
                <p class="blog-text">By being a marketer.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Understanding your target customers, their habits, expectations and how to reach them. You must do some research. You can't do anything without research.</p>

                <h2 class="text-title">How to make a fast start?</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">It's an easy decision. You need to crush your ego, but eventually in any case you need to do that if you want to become a successful and mature person. Become a copykitty. Become a purple cow if you can, but being a copykitty is ok for now.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Find a person or business already successful in the industry close to your niche. Analyse the business and all visible actions. Contact them and ask for advice. If you can, offer them money to share an example of their workflow.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">Of course, you will not contact your direct competition, but someone who looks like. Starting with an organized set of actions is the best start for anything. Even learning new skills.</p>
                <p class="blog-text">During that process, you can define your future needs, change tools and tactics, upgrade and reorganize.</p>

                <h2 class="text-title">What about gurus?</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">"Gurus" are mostly rich, but they will not make you rich because the reason for them becoming rich is promising that they will make you rich. </p>
                <p class="blog-text">They became rich offering you a service that you need but they can't provide. Your goal is to succeed healthily, providing value to your customers in exchange for income.</p>

                <h2 class="text-title">That would be all for now</h2>
